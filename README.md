# Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA)

## About
I gave this presentation during the [MATH 287D Statistical Learning](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~jbradic/math287d.html) class that I took at UCSD. The paper's main contribution is that it provided theoretical guarantees on the convergence rate of the duality gap of SDCA. After reading the paper, I implemented the algorithm in R, and examined the convergence rate of the duality gap under different loss functions through simulations and compared it to the theoretical results.
